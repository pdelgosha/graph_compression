\doxysection*{Installation}

\doxysubsection*{Prerequisites}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item c++ compiler
\item \href{https://www.boost.org/}{\texttt{ Boost}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{Compile}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make\ all}

\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysection*{Usage}

In what follows, {\ttfamily gcomp.\+o} is the compiled executable generated by the makefile.

\doxysubsection*{Compression}

The graph should be given as an input text file in the edge list format described as follows.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The first line specifies the number of vertices, say {\ttfamily n}.
\item The second line includes the mark of {\ttfamily n} vertices each as an integer. If the graph is unmarked, the second line consists of {\ttfamily n} zeros.
\item The third line includes the number of edges in the graph, say {\ttfamily m}.
\item Then we have {\ttfamily m} lines each for an edge represented as {\ttfamily i j x y}, where {\ttfamily i} and {\ttfamily j} are the indices of the endpoint, and {\ttfamily x} and {\ttfamily y} are marks (as integers) representing the mark of the edge towards {\ttfamily i} and {\ttfamily j}, respectively.
\end{DoxyItemize}

To compress such a marked graph stored in the file {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}input graph\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, use the following command. Here, {\ttfamily h} and {\ttfamily d} are the two height and degree hyperparameters of the compression algorithm (see the paper for details, and the following note regarding these hyperparameters). Also, {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}compressed graph file name\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} is the name of the file where the compressed graph is going to be stored.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gcomp.o\ -\/i\ <input\ graph>\ -\/h\ <h>\ -\/d\ <d>\ -\/o\ <compressed\ graph\ file\ name>}

\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysubsubsection*{Additional logging options}

The following are optional.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/v}\+: verbose mode, which prints the compression / decompression progress.
\item {\ttfamily -\/V \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}log file\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}\+: if specified, the log is stored in {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}log file\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsection*{Decompression}

To decompress a compressed graph stored in file {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}compressed graph file name\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, run the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{gcomp.o\ -\/u\ -\/i\ <compressed\ graph\ file\ name>\ -\/o\ <reconstructed\ graph\ file\ name>}

\end{DoxyCode}


Here, the {\ttfamily -\/u} option specifies the decomperssion mode, and the reconstructed graph will be stored in the file {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}reconstructed graph file name\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}, in the same edge list format explained in the compression phase.

\doxysubsection*{A note on hyperparameters}

Regrading the height and degree hyperparameters ({\ttfamily h} and {\ttfamily d}, respectively), please see the paper for more details. In theory, the optimal asymptotic behavior is obtained as both {\ttfamily h} and {\ttfamily d} go to infinity. However, in practice, usually best performance is obtained for {\ttfamily h} in the range 1, 2, 3. The choice of {\ttfamily d} very much depends on the degree distribution of the graph, but usually a trial with small values such as 2, 5, 10, 20 should yield satisfactory results.
